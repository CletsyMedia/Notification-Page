### What I learned
I learned important keystrokes and nesting divs and some stylings in CSS also the importance of arrow functions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="notification">
     nested divs      
</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  css variables
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  forEach loop
  arrow=()=>
}
```
